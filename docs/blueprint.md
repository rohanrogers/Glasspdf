# **App Name**: GlassPDF

## Core Features:

- Merge PDF: Upload multiple PDF files and rearrange their order via drag-and-drop, then merge them into a single PDF using MuPDF engine.
- Split PDF: Split a PDF file by page range, individual pages, or extracting selected pages using MuPDF engine.
- Compress PDF: Compress a PDF file with multiple compression level options and estimate the final output size using MuPDF engine.
- Drag and Drop Interface: Smooth drag-and-drop interface to upload, rearrange and select files for processing.
- Performance Optimization: Optimized application with no UI lag, and a clean layout that eliminates overlapping UI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#A7D1F5) to create a calm and professional atmosphere, reminiscent of glass.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to create a subtle backdrop, reinforcing the glassmorphism effect.
- Accent color: Slightly darker blue (#75A9D1) used for interactive elements and highlights, adding depth to the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used for both headlines and body text for a modern and clean look.
- Simple and clean icons for tools (merge, split, compress), consistent with glassmorphism, with a subtle translucent effect.
- Clean and non-overlapping layouts with clear spacing, designed to eliminate scrollbars, properly sized thumbnails, and easy drag-and-drop areas.
- Subtle animations for feedback on user actions (e.g., file uploads, drag-and-drop actions, processing progress).
